Covered basic stuff, then jumped around a bit.

Will do a part 2 that has some more advanced stuff,
can recommend people do some of the basics.

Might split slide up a bit.


Popular topics/questions:

Navigation in less
history and history manipulation (I think)
grepping / finding of files

Will try to follow up with some individuals about
what they might like to see in part 2.
