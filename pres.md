ðŸ™¿  Jon's Favorite Command-Line Tips and Tricks  ðŸ™¾
===================================================

In this case - comamnd-line means bash w/ mostly defaults ;)

Slideshow is being run via `mdp pres.md`, which makes slides
out of markdown!

Git repo for pres: https://github.com/UIUCLibrary/jtg-cli-pres-2022-08-19


##Conventions: 

*filename*
`command -la input`
_keyboard press_

Know a better tool? Let me know as we go!

ðŸ™¿  Resources
=========


## Command Line Fu - https://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/browse

  Fun snippets of command lines with descriptions. Be sure to check
  out https://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/browse/sort-by-votes.


## UNIX Power Tools, 3rd Edition - https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/unix-power-tools/0596003307/ 

  Older, but chock-full of goodies.


## Linux Documentation Project - https://tldp.org/guides.html

  Used to be great, but pretty stale. Still, has 
  good resources on certain subjects. 
  
  The few times I have to deal with a bash script, I'll
  reference "Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide" https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/

-----------------------------------------------------



ðŸ™¿  Disabling terminal beep
=======================

The details of how to do this will vary with distro and terminal program...but
editing the */etc/inputrc* to set bell-stype to none

`set bell-style none`

Google is your friend here

Some programs will also have annoying sounds. Google can help too.

--------------------------------------------

ðŸ™¿  Getting help
================

## man
`man command`  - manual page

## info - less popular than man
`info command` - info pages

## "World Wide Web" 
kids seem to like it these days

You might see older resources talk about `apropos`, which searches descriptions 
but I'd only recommend it in cases you don't have net access

----------------------------------------------------------

ðŸ™¿  Command Navigation
==================

| Tab                | autocomplete               |
| Control left/right | one "word" left or right   |
| Control-a          | start of line              |
| Control-e          | end of line                |
| Control-l          | clear screen               |
| Control-c          | cancel                     |
| Control-d          | another type of cancel ;)  |

--------------------------------------------------

ðŸ™¿  Filesystem Navigation
=====================

## Shortcuts

| ~  | Your home directory |
| .  | Current directory   |
| .. | Parent directory    |

## Commands

| `ls`         | list files in current working directory |
| `cd path`    | classic change directory      |
| `pushd path` | like cd, but keeps track      |
| `popd`       | go back to previous directory |                        


--------------------------------------------------

ðŸ™¿  Previous commands & History
===========================


| _up arrow_     | previous command         |
| _down arrow_   | next command             |
| _control-r_    | will let you start to search history by typing |
| _control-p_    | pastes last command into the terminal, but doesn't execute |


`history` command will show history

Can rerun a command via `!n` where n is the line number listed in the history command.

"Print" to terminal via `!n:p` 
 
## tip! Clean up history

Had a comamnd you don't want hanging around in 
history? use `history -d n` to delete that entry

-----------------------------------------

ðŸ™¿  Pipes and Redirects - basics
================================

##  | (pipe)
sends output to another command, for example
`date | rev` leads to "2202 TDC 25:91:51 81 guA uhT"

## > (greater than)
`date > /tmp/example.txt` 
writes stdout to file, overwriting the file if it already  exists . 
Try doing the above command twice several times and then 
doing `cat /tmp/example.txt`. You should see only one datetime stamp.

## >> (double greater than)
`date >> /tmp/examples.txt`
appends stdout to file.                                                         |

Do this a few times, and then check with 
`cat /tmp/example.txt`. You should see several 
timestamps

## `tee` 
 `date | tee /tmp/example.txt` 

tee is a command that sends out to the
terminal and to a file. It will overwrite by default,
but if you do `tee -a` it'll append



---------------------------------------------

ðŸ™¿  Pipes and Redirect - stdout and stderr
==========================================

A command actualy has two "channels" or "streams", 
stdout and stderr. By default, both of these go to 
terminal and occasionally can make things confusing.

## >& (greater than - ampersand) - merge the streams 

`./outputs.sh > /tmp/example_all_lines.txt 2>&1` 

Sends stderr as well as stdout to */tmp/example_all_lines.txt*.
Othewrise warnings and errors would only show on the terminal

## tip

You can also send "stdout" and "stderr" into different places, including the
void known as "/dev/null"

`./outputs.sh 2> /dev/null` 

That will send "stdout" to terminal and stderr to the "void"

--------------------------------------------------

ðŸ™¿  Shell Expansion/Globbing
============================

Asterisk (*) will match any characters 

So `ls \*txt` will list all the text file in the directory.

-----------------------------------------------------------------


ðŸ™¿  Simple file reading

## less 

  `less` is a "pager" program for reading files, usually now the default 
   on most system. (less replaces more, an old favorite linux joke)

`less -n` will include line numbers


## less - Useful keyboard shortcuts

| _g_ | go to the start |
| _G_ | go to the end   |
| _/search phrase_ | search current line to end, just use _/_ to search for next occurance |
| :gg | go to line |

## head & tail

  `head -n x`  - shows the first x lines of a file
  `tail -n x`  - shows the last x lines of a file
  `tail -n +1` - show all lines of a file after the 
                  first line, useful for csv files w/ headers
                  and content on top, aka `tail -n +1 star_trek.tsv`



------------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸ™¿  grep
========

search lines of files or from pipe

## -P

  Use perl regular expressions instead of the less common ?posix? 
  one used by grep

## -v

  Inverse, show lines that do NOT match the pattern, such as `grep -v '^#'`
  to show non-comment lines.
  
## -o
  
  Only return match, not the whole line it occurs in
  
Actual use of grep recently - trying to remember what AD account I used in ldapsearch
`history | grep -oP "CN=[^']*'" | sort | uniq`

CN=lib-adinfo-ad-lookup,OU=Service Accounts,OU=Library,OU=Urbana,DC=ad,DC=uillinois,DC=edu'
CN=,lib-adinfo-lookup,OU=Service Accounts,,OU=Library,OU=Urbana,DC=ad,DC=uillinois,DC=edu'
CN=lib-adinfo-lookup,OU=Service Accounts,OU=Library,OU=Urbana,DC=ad,DC=uillinois,DC=edu'
CN=LibADLookup Service Account,OU=SU Accounts,OU=Library,OU=Urbana,DC=ad,DC=uillinois,DC=edu'

--------------------------------------------------

ðŸ™¿  alias
=========

Stick in bottom of .bashrc/.bash_profile (depends on linx distro exactly.

Alias on left, command to run on right

alias get="git"
alias jump-biling="ssh lib-feed-billing@batch-centos7.library.illinois.edu"

Remember to `source ~/.bashrc` afterwards!

--------------------------------------------------------

ðŸ™¿  screen
==========

Keep a session going on a remote server, even if 
connection drops. Very useful in these days of remote work.


_ctrl+a_ _d_ - "detach" session. recommended if you know you're going to leave

`screen -r` - resume session.

If you read up on the command there's ways to name sessions and 
other useful tricks.

--------------------------------------------------

ðŸ™¿  xclip
=========

Useful for taking command line input and putting it direction into


Sometimes can get confusing dpeending on where you're going to paste, you probably want primary (default) or clipoboard.

`perl -e 'print join('\n',(1.1000)) | xclip -sel clip`

xclip can also take in a text file

`xclip project_gutenberg/23042-0.txt`


--------------------------------------------------

ðŸ™¿  find - cumbersome, but useful 
=================================


`find starting-directory find_options`

## Files made within the last day in your home directory and below

`find ~ -mtime -1`

## Execute a command

`find . -iname '*txt' -exec md5sum {} \;

That backslash-semicolon is important!

--------------------------------------------------

ðŸ™¿  xargs
============

Run a command on input


## Deailing with whitespace w/ find

`find . -mtime -1 -print0 | xargs -0 -n 1` 




--------------------------------------------------

ðŸ™¿  qrencode
============


`qrencode 'some_text_url_is_handy' -o filename.png`


--------------------------------------------------

ðŸ™¿  cut and paste 
=================

Rearrange tabluar data via `cut` and `paste`


--------------------------------------------------

ðŸ™¿  sshfs
=========

Mount remote directories to local file system via ssh


--------------------------------------------------
ðŸ™¿  remember ssh can execute commands 
======================================

ssh server_conn_string "comamnd"

useful for pairing with commands like xclip


--------------------------------------------------

ðŸ™¿   dig -x
============

reverse lookup by ip address

`dig +noall +answer -x 130.126.162.52`

52.162.126.130.in-addr.arpa. 5	IN	PTR	quest.library.illinois.edu.
52.162.126.130.in-addr.arpa. 5	IN	PTR	iisprod1.library.illinois.edu.
52.162.126.130.in-addr.arpa. 5	IN	PTR	s1.library.illinois.edu.
52.162.126.130.in-addr.arpa. 5	IN	PTR	www-s1.library.illinois.edu.
52.162.126.130.in-addr.arpa. 5	IN	PTR	web.library.illinois.edu.


--------------------------------------------------

ðŸ™¿  Unicode Tools
=================

Emacs - has nice _Alt-x_, 'insert-char' and _Alt-x_, 'describe-char'

`xxd filename` when you absolutely need to know the raw bytes.

In Ubuntu terminal - _left ctl_ + _left shift_ + _u_

Enter in the unicode code point. Use only lower-case letters for the alpha characters.

------------------------------------------------------------


ðŸ™¿  watch
==========

`watch -n x command`

Rerun the command every x seconds (w/o flag, think it's 2 seconds by default)


--------------------------------------------------


ðŸ™¿  wget & curl

I tend to use `wget` to fetch files that I want on the file system

`wget https://www.gutenberg.org/files/23042/23042-0.txt`

It's also handy for mirroring websites, or slurping down parts of a website,
but you'll probaby have to experiment a bit with the flags
to get what you want.

`wget --mirror --convert-links --adjust-extension --page-requisites --level 1  https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23042`

`curl` is a useful tool for checking headers, getting content, but it's a bit more complicated

to do the above in curl (since it's a text file)

`curl https://www.gutenberg.org/files/23042/23042-0.txt > tempest.txt`

Can be useful in some situations, like debugging a web server on the machine itself

`curl -D - https://www.gutenberg.org/files/23042/23042-0.txt` | less

Will dump the headers actually being returned at the top of the file and the body
of the reponse below it.

--------------------------------------------------


ðŸ™¿  ncdu - navigating file sizes

ncurses interactiv3e terminal that shows a  tree view of a directory structure, handly for looking for unusually large files.
